## 🦊 What is Foxems?

**Foxems is me** — my personal brand and digital identity. This is my living, breathing dashboard that tracks my journey through anime, gaming, and development. This isn't just a portfolio; it's a real-time reflection of my digital life.

> *"I track my anime journey, gaming achievements, and development projects. Explore my stats and see what I'm up to."*

---

## ⚠️ Personal Project Notice

**This is a personal website highly customized for my specific use case.** It will **not** work out of the box for others without significant modifications.

### What You Need to Change:
- **MyAnimeList Username** — Hardcoded in the data export (`Foxems`)
- **Steam Profile** — Requires your own Steam ID and API key
- **Data Source Paths** — File paths are specific to my local FoxCLI setup
- **Personal Branding** — All Foxems branding and content is personal

If you want to use this code, you'll need to:
1. Search for hardcoded values in the codebase and replace them with your own
2. Set up your own data export system (or modify to use APIs directly)
3. Update all personal content, images, and branding

> *This repository is primarily for my own reference and backup. Feel free to use it as inspiration, but expect to do significant customization work.*
